# Paranoia

Not gonna take my car tonight,  
I'm gonna take a walk.  
*They* track my movements, left and right,  
Each minute after work.

Newspaper lying on the floor,  
Saying, "Looking for a nanny",  
Those liars, it's *me* they're looking for,  
*They'll* have me dead and take my money.

My neighbor walking by my door,  
"Hi Jim," he says in fake kind voice.  
I don't believe his acting though,  
He's in with *them*, I gotta run from Illinois.

"Alarm's been beeping at your house," he says,  
I say, "I'm gonna check it out".  
*They* must be here! Oh yes, oh yes!  
I'm walking silently, it's *them*, no doubt!

Unlocked my door, I gotta have an eyeful,  
Tiptoed through corridor,  
And from a secret spot took out my rifle.  
Sudden knocks on my front door!

"Order for..." a shout I hear,  
*They* ordered me, my doom!  
"Oh, wrong one, sorry sir!"  
No time to waste, I aim and... boom!

*Front door is open, blood splattered on the rocks.*  
*The view expanded wide, as if on a projector:*  
*Old man with rifle, dead body, pizza box.*  
*And loud beeping of carbon monoxide detector.*
